# General immersion theory

Welcome to my general immersion language learning guide. 
This guide lays the groundwork for what immersion is and how it works. It's written generally such that the it can be applied to acquire any language that has a writing system, without changing the underlying concepts of the immersion method. 
Think of this guide as a paint brush. You use this paint brush to acquire your target language i.e paint your painting. But what kind of language resources (colors) you end up using will depend on your target language, so please refer to language specific language guides for concrete resources on what the most viable resources there are.

This guide will just provide a paint brush (method and mindset) so *you* can paint (learn your target language). This guide will not contain the colors (resources) you need for your painting (target language) because every painting (language) is different.

Similarly any numerical statements like ratios or percentages are only suggestions and are subject to be changed depending on your target language peculiarities. There is no one size fits all equation especially for languages and the people who study them, so keep this in mind.
